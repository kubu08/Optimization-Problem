    "Consider a growth model without capital. Instead, output is produced using labor and energy. Energy comes in two forms, a \"dirty\" and a \"clean\" variant. Using dirty energy $e_t$ causes emissions of a pollutant and hence a *pollution externality*: it contributes to a stock of the pollutant which negatively affects production. Apart from this negative productivity effect, there is no other cost of dirty energy use. In contrast, clean energy $r_t$ does not cause pollution, but has a constant marginal cost $\\rho$, paid in output units. \n",
